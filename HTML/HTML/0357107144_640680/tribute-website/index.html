        <h2>The Creator of Emojis</h2>
        <p>
          Shigetaka Kurita is a Japanese interface designer and often cited for his early work with emoji
          sets. Many refer to him as the creator of the emoji, a claim clarified in recent years. His
          innovation would be intepreted by
          <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/29/gboard-emoji-kitchen-how-to-examples/">Google</a>
          and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202332">Apple</a>, and integrated into their
          keyboards for widespread, universal communication.
        </p>

        <p>
          The word emoji comes from the Japanese 絵 ("e," picture), 文 ("mo," write) and 字 ("ji," character).
          Japanese characters, or "kanji," are largely based on Chinese ideograms, meaning the language's
          writing system is already highly pictorial.

            concepts into 12-bit symbols, all within 5 weeks time, most designers would faint at the idea.<br

          Emojis used to be on an odd bitmap set. Centering these were a pain, so emojis eventually evovled to
          be vector images with unlimited sizes.
